# Wi-Fi-4WD-Using-NodeMCU-8266
•A Four-Wheel Drive (4WD) that could be controlled by a phone over Wi-Fi was made by using a NodeMCU 8266. •A motor driver shield was used alongside the NodeMCU in order to control the four motors of the vehicle. •An Android app is used as a Graphic user interface for the user to control the motors wirelessly by the means of Wi-Fi. •The four motors work individually and thus can manage to turn around without any hassle as opposed to a two-wheel drive.
